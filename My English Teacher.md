# My English Teacher 
David Bickford, a humorous and warm-hearted British man, has taught me two years’ oral English during my campus life, I would rather introduce him as my best friend ever than just a teacher of mine, because he delighted me with unconditional friendship and generous understanding when I felt lost in Xi’an as a stranger in that metro city. That’s also the time when I became a friend of myself. 
As an English teacher, David knows a lot about how to make students got interested and involved in the class. As a British in China, he does charity for years he lives in xi’an, like orphans adoption. As a friend, every year he invites foreign teachers he knows who come Xi’an from his hometown to have meetings at colleges so as to give local students the annual native English corner, afterwards he gives the new teachers academic teaching training, once I was invited gracefully. 
Although I’ve already left campus, the warmth of friends I’ll never leave behind, that’s the reason for existence I guess.
