# # My English Teacher
David Bickford, a humorous and warm-hearted British man, has taught me two years’ oral English during my campus life, I would rather introduce him as my best friend ever than just a teacher, because he delighted my gloomy days, with unconditional friendship and generous understanding. 
As a British in China, he does charity for years, such as orphans adoption. As a friend, he invites foreign teachers coming Xi’an to hold native English corner annually for local students, afterwards he trains the new teachers who are willing to teach in China, once I was invited gracefully. 
Although I’ve already left campus, the warmth of friends I’ll never leave behind, that’s the reason for existence I guess.
